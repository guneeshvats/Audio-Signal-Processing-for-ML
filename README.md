Audio Signal Processing for ML

In this repository, I am keeping track of what I am learning from the course of Valerio Velerado [Audio Signal Processing for ML](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-wATfeyAMNqIee7cH3q1bh4QJFAaeNv0)
For each lecture I have notes in `.txt` and `.pdf format` (only for few lec) and practice in the ipynb files
Mostly I have used librosa library for audio processing. 

Following are the list of features and topics I have learned in the course. 
## Table of Features, Learnings, and Applications

| Feature                         | Link to Section                                      | What I Learned                                                       |
