2 stages of Speech Model 
  1. Develpoment and training 
  2. Preparing the raw audio data 

What is going to be covered in this course: 
  1. Sound Waves 
  2. DAC / ADC
  3. Time and Freq Domain Features  
  4. Audio Transformations
    a) FT / STFT
    b) Constant Q transform 
    c) Mel Spectogram
    d) Chromograms 
  5. Audio and Music Perception 

Theory and Coding will be covered in this course. 
We are going to use Python and Librosa (open source audio processing library)

What we will learn 
  1. Deep understanding of audio data
  2. Freq/Time domain Features
  3. Extract features from raw audio 
  4 Recognize which features to use for ML applications 
  5. Preprocess audio data for ML
  6. Understand math behind audio transformations
